# Installation and Running
Clone this repository and open it in the unity editor, 20121.1.16f1 or later. Make sure you have Windows tools for Visual Studio 2019 installed, otherwise the Burst compiler will fail to run. Include all scenes. Open three instances of the resultant exe, have one host a server and the other two create clients. Click "host server" on the server, and "connect" on the two clients (leave the ip field blank to default to localhost).
